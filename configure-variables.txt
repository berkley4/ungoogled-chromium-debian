## General options

AUTHOR		"ungoogled-chromium Maintainers <github@null.invalid>"
RELEASE		unstable
VERSION		<version>	When unset the version is made via chromium_version.txt and
				revision.txt from debian/submodules/ungoogled-chromium

STABLE		0		By default an unstable version is built

NON_FREE	1		Anyone distributing built debs should configure with NON_FREE=0
				in order to comply with licencing laws. This variable will disable
                                all bromite and vanadium patches, plus set SUPERVISED_USER=1 and
                                force-enable SYS_OPENH264 if OPENH264 is enabled.

SYMBOLS		0		symbol_level build flag: -1 = auto-set; 0 = none; 1 = minimal; 2 = regular
SYMBOLS_BLINK	0		blink_symbol_level build flag: -1 = auto-set; 0 = minimal; 1 = medium; 2 = regular

C_VER		<version>	Override the default clang version (for use with SYS_CLANG > 0)
				The script default is hardcoded to that of the bundled copy

SYS_CLANG	0		Use in-tree chromium clang/llvm binaries
		1		Use a system clang package (eg from apt.llvm.org)
		2		Use clang installed in /usr/local (self built)

SYS_RUST	0		Use in-tree chromium rust binaries
		1		Use a system rustc package (eg from debian unstable/backports repo)
		2		Use rust installed to $HOME/.cargo/bin (see https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/)

SYS_RUST_FORCE	0		This forces SYS_RUST=1 when your packaged version is roughly as new as upstream

LTO_DIR		<dir>		Default iis <source root>/out/Release/thinlto-cache

PGO		1		Enable/disable building with PGO profile optimisation

POLICIES	1		Install /etc/chromium/policies/managed/policies.json

SKIA_GAMMA	0		Set the gamma value for text blitting
				Set to 1 to set a gamma value of 2.2
				Set within the range 1.0 - 3.0 (always give one decimal place) for other values

X11_ONLY	0		When enabled is an alias for OZONE_WAYLAND=0
				Wayland users can also enable (the ozone wayland platform is experimental)

TARBALL		0		Use tarball download instead of git
DL_CACHE	<dir>		Default is ../download_cache (one level up from source tree; active when TARBALL=1)

## Components/features that can be enabled/disabled exclusively via patches

ATK_DBUS	1		Accessibility/D-Bus support (d-bus is only used for bluetooth)
CATAPULT	1		Catapult profiling support
OAUTH2		0		Enable OAuth 2.0 client switches
SUPERVISED_USER	0		Parental control related component (relies on a bromite patch)
TRANSLATE	1		Google translate support
				0 - disable
				1 - enable (need to edit /etc/chromium.d/google-translate)
				2 - enable completely

## Managed Browser Policy Settings
DNS_BUILTIN	0		Internal chromium DNS-over-HTTPS client
DNS_INTERCEPT	1		DNS interception checking (helps protect against hijacking/poisoning)
DNS_HOST	<hostname>	To set https://dns.example.net/dns-query{?dns} as DNS-over-HTTPS
				resolver, run: DNS_HOST=dns.example.net ./debian/configure.sh

CAP		1		Toggle for all capture features (needed for WebRTC)
CAP_AUD		1		Audio capture
CAP_SCR		1		Screen capture (desktop sharing)
CAP_VID		1		Video capture

## Enable/Disable features/components/patches

OZONE_WAYLAND	1		Wayland ozone platform (experimental; can be disabled by wayland users)
PDF_JS		0		PDF javascript support
PIPEWIRE	1
PRINT_PREVIEW	1		Can be disabled to replace the print dialogue with the system one
PULSE		1		Pulseaudio
QT		1		Runtime autodetected (eg Gnome desktops will ignore)
SPEECH		1		Speech service (voice recognition)
VR		0		Virtual reality hardware support
WEBGPU		0		Not enabled upstream on linux yet (likely beta quality)
WIDEVINE	1		Needs various extra components to enable


## Libraries

OPENH264	1		Used for software h264 media encoding and webrtc h264 encoding/decoding
				Enable building with OpenH264 support

VAAPI		1		Used for hardware encoding/decoding

SYS_FREETYPE	0		Needed for system fontconfig; dependencies: brotli and libpng
SYS_HARFBUZZ	1
SYS_ICU		1
SYS_JPEG	1
SYS_OPENH264	1		The bundled OpenH264 library (SYS_OPENH264=0) cannot be redistributed

# Unsupported

SYS_FFMPEG	0		Unsupported upstream for security reasons
				Functional issues (eg media not playing)
				Only enable if you have patched and rebuilt your system ffmpeg


## CPU threading options

LTO_JOBS	0		<0-99> : number of threads to use for linking (with lld)
XZ_EXTREME	0		Extreme xz (deb) compression strategy

				Enabled by default if XZ_EXTREME=1 (unless force-disabled)


## CPU architecture/instructions and optimisations

INTEL_CET	1		Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (Tiger Lake or newer CPUs)
MF_SPLIT	1		Machine function splitting (requires PGO=1)

MARCH		x86-64-v2	Matches MTUNE if MTUNE is set and MARCH is not specified
				Will not match MTUNE if MTUNE is set to generic
				Setting MARCH to generic will reset MARCH and MTUNE to their defaults

MTUNE		generic		Matches MARCH if MARCH is set and MTUNE is not specified
				Will be set to generic if MARCH is an x86-64 microarchitecture level

AES_PCLMUL	1		Intel Westmere/AMD Jaguar (might be missing on some earlier/lower end)
