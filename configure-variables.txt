## General options

AUTHOR		"ungoogled-chromium Maintainers <github@null.invalid>"
RELEASE		unstable
VERSION		<version>
LTO_DIR		<dir>		Default iis <source root>/out/Release/thinlto-cache

BUNDLED_CLANG	0		Use in-tree chromium clang/llvm binaries
POLICIES	0		Install /etc/chromium/policies/managed/policies.json
TARBALL		0		Use tarball download instead of git
STABLE		0		By default an unstable version is built


## Components that can be enabled/disabled via patches

ATK_DBUS	1		D-Bus support (for bluetooth)
CATAPULT	1		Catapult profiling support
TRANSLATE	0		Google translate support


## Enable/Disable components

DRIVER		1		Chromedriver package

MUTEX_PI	1		Mutex priority inheritance (see base/synchronization/lock_impl_posix.cc)
OOP_PR		0		Out of process printing (X11 only)
PDF_JS		0		PDF javascript support
PIPEWIRE	1
PULSE		1
QT		1		Runtime autodetected (eg Gnome desktops will ignore)
VR		0		Virtual reality hardware support
WEBGPU		0		Not enabled upstream on linux yet (likely beta quality)
WIDEVINE	1		Needs various extra components to enable


## Libraries

OPENH264	1
VAAPI		1

SYS_JPEG	1
SYS_USB		0		Not normally needed by most people
SYS_ICU		1

SYS_FFMPEG	0		Unsupported upstream for security reasons
				Functional issues (eg videos not playing)
				Needs a patched version of ffmpeg to build and run


## CPU threading options

LTO_JOBS	0		<0-99> : number of threads to use for linking (with lld)
XZ_EXTREME	0		Extreme xz (deb) compression strategy
XZ_THREADED	0		Multi-threaded xz compression (number of threads = $JOBS)


## CPU architecture/instructions and optimisations

MARCH		x86-64-v2	Matches MTUNE if MTUNE is set and MARCH is not specified
				Will not match MTUNE if MTUNE is set to generic
				Setting MARCH to generic will reset MARCH and MTUNE to their defaults

MTUNE		generic		Matches MARCH if MARCH is set and MTUNE is not specified
				Will be set to generic if MARCH is an x86-64 microarchitecture level

AES_PCLMUL	1		Intel Westmere/AMD Jaguar (might be missing on some earlier/lower end)
AVX		1		Intel Sandybridge/AMD Bulldozer era (circa 2011) onwards
AVX2		0		Intel Haswell/AMD Excavator or newer
V8_AVX2		0		AVX2 for v8 javascript (can enable on non-AVX2 capable hosts)

POLLY_VECTOR	1		Polly vectorisation (oportunistic vector instruction optimisation)
POLLY_EXTRA	1		Polly extra compile optimisations

POLLY_PARALLEL	0		Polly parallisation (opportunistic multi-threading)
				Not recommended; probably introduces bugs (especially in javascript)
