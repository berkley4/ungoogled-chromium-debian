## CPU architecture/instructions and optimisations

MARCH		x86-64-v2	Matches MTUNE if MTUNE is set and MARCH is not specified
				Will not match MTUNE if MTUNE is set to generic
				Setting MARCH to generic will reset MARCH and MTUNE to their defaults

MTUNE		generic		Matches MARCH if MARCH is set and MTUNE is not specified
				Will be set to generic if MARCH is an x86-64 microarchitecture level

AES_PCLMUL	1		Intel Westmere/AMD Jaguar (might be missing on some earlier/lower end)
AVX		1		Intel Sandybridge/AMD Bulldozer era (circa 2011) onwards
AVX2		1		Intel Haswell/AMD Excavator or newer
RTC_AVX2	1		AVX2 for RTC (builds and runs on non-AVX2 capable hosts)
V8_AVX2		1		AVX2 for v8 javascript (builds and runs on non-AVX2 capable hosts)

POLLY_VEC	1		Polly vectorisation (oportunistic vector instruction optimisation)
POLLY_EXT	1		Polly extra compile optimisations
