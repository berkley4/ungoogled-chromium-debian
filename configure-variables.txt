<OPTION>	<DEFAULT>	<DESCRIPTION>

## General options

AUTHOR			"ungoogled-chromium Maintainers <github@null.invalid>"
RELEASE			unstable
VERSION			<version>	When unset the version is made via chromium_version.txt and
					revision.txt from debian/submodules/ungoogled-chromium

STABLE			0		By default an unstable version is built

NON_FREE		1		Anyone distributing built debs should configure with NON_FREE=0
					in order to comply with licencing laws. This variable will disable
					all bromite and vanadium patches, plus error out if SYS_OPENH264=0
					when OPENH264=1.

SYMBOLS			0		symbol_level build flag: -1 = auto-set; 0 = none; 1 = minimal; 2 = regular
SYMBOLS_BLINK		0		blink_symbol_level build flag: -1 = auto-set; 0 = minimal; 1 = medium; 2 = regular

CLANG_VER		<major ver>	Override the default clang version.
					Set this to skip querying the chrome binary for version info. Only do so if you know for
					sure that you have a particular version installed. If CLANG_VER is not set then	you will
					get an error if you do not have a version installed which at least equals the version of
					LLEV_VERSION in debian/rules.in. This setting has no effect if SYS_CLANG=0.

SYS_CLANG		0		Use in-tree chromium clang/llvm binaries
			1		Use a system clang package (eg from apt.llvm.org)
			2		Use clang installed in /usr/local (self built)
					Refer to Toolchain.md for more details.

SYS_RUST		0		Use in-tree chromium rust binaries (default)
			1		Use a system rustc package (eg from debian unstable/backports repo)
			2		Use rust installed to $HOME/.cargo/bin (Recommended method)
					Refer to Rust.md for more details.

CCACHE			0		Enable the use of the the ccache compilation cache utility

ESBUILD			0		Use the faster ESbuild javascript bundler instead of the default rollup
					The slight package size increase means this is probably only worth enabling on fast machines

LTO_DIR			<dir>		Default iis <source root>/out/Release/thinlto-cache

PGO			1		Enable/disable building with PGO profile optimisation

SKIA_GAMMA		0		Set the gamma value for text blitting
					Set to 1 to set a gamma value of 2.2
					Set within the range 1.0 - 3.0 (always give one decimal place) for other values

X11_ONLY		0		When enabled is an alias for OZONE_WAYLAND=0
					Wayland users can also enable (the ozone wayland platform is experimental)

SWITCH_BLOCKING		1		Control what gets blocked by the blocklist (/etc/chromium.d/block)
					0 = Block nothing
					1 = Block matching flags from flag files
					2 = Same as 1 plus block matching flags from the command line
					3 = Same as 2 plus all other command line flags

## Managed Browser Policy Settings

CAP			1		Toggle for all capture features (needed for WebRTC)
CAP_AUD			1		Audio capture
CAP_SCR			1		Screen capture (desktop sharing)
CAP_VID			1		Video capture

					resolver, run: DNS_HOST=dns.example.net ./debian/configure.sh

# Required for DNS interception detection
DNS_CONFIG		1		Enable monitoring for changes in system DNS configuration
