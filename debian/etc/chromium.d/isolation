# General info: some of these prefs might be already covered by existing
# patches. However, it probably won't hurt to enable some of these, even
# if they've been pre-enabled via patch.

# Note: this breaks the document.domain feature of websites which itself 
#       is in the process of being obsoleted due to security concerns.

# Intended for diagnosing bugs that may be due to out-of-process iframes.
